## Dataset Overview

This dataset includes annotated 3D point cloud scans of several plant species for various plant organs (e.g., embryonic leaves, petioles, stems, etc.). 
The data was collected using the LeasyScan high-throughput phenotyping platform, which uses **Phenospex PlantEye F600** scanners. The dataset is ideal for use in, e.g., **3D computer vision**, **plant phenotyping** research.

## Data acquisition
The presented data were generated using a commercially available PlantEye technology (F600), which is a unique plant phenotyping sensor that combines a 3D scanner with multispectral imaging ([PlantEye F600 multispectral 3D scanner for plants - PHENOSPEX](https://phenospex.com/products/plant-phenotyping/planteye-f600-multispectral-3d-scanner-for-plants/)).
The provided data comes from three regular experimentations in 2022 and 2023 at the ICRISAT field (located in Hyderabad, India). Please see the published paper for details. 

## Raw data preprocessing

The dataset includes a preprocessing code that can be used for the raw point cloud data. The key steps include:

1.  **Rotation** of point clouds to align the plant on the x-plane.
2.  **Merging** merging the point clouds from the two scanners into one file.
3.  **Voxelization** to adjust the resolution of the point cloud.
4.  **Soil Segmentation** to separate plants from soil and trays using AI-based algorithms.

Refer to the published paper for detailed description.

## Data Annotation
The data were annotated using the online platform Segments.ai (https://segments.ai) under an academic license.
Annotations are provided for the following plant organs:

*   Embryonic leaf
*   Leaf
*   Petiole
*   Stem
*   Plant

The Plant class was added for the plants that are, e.g., distorted by wind and do not allow humans to distinguish the plant organs.

## Data Format

* Raw data are proviuded in **.PLY format**; see https://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/ for details. 
* Annotated point clouds are provided in **.PCD format**; see https://pcl.readthedocs.io/projects/tutorials/en/latest/pcd_file_format.html for details.
* Annotations:
  * Generated cuboids are using KITTI format; see https://github.com/dtczhl/dtc-KITTI-For-Beginners/blob/master/README.md for details.
  * Segmentation annotations are in the original format from the Segments.ai platform, see `Segments-ai annotation format.md`.
